# myRIO Square Wave Generator
A Virtual Instrument which is to be deployed onto a National Instruments myRIO to generate a square wave. This wave can be used to simulate data from a wheel speed type sensor.

The VI contains a control panel which displays errors (unused in this version), and controls for the pulse width (as a percentage of the wave frequency) and wave frequency (in Hertz).

## Using the Minimal Project
Download/Fork the project.

- Open LabVIEW 2021, **32 bit** on the S404 PCs, this is **not** the version which shows up when typing into the Start Menu.
-   Scroll down the programs in the Start Menu until reaching **N** open the **orange** "NI LabVIEW 2021 SP1" application.

### Note
In a real world use case, many files from this example would have been omitted using a .gitignore file. To locate the main source file, navigate to "Core"->"Src"->"main.c".
